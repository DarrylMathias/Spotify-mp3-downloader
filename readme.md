# Spotify MP3 Downloader

This tool by Darryl Mathias was inspired by the many Python-based music downloaders out there and my personal pain for not being able to download (*sigh*) :(  ‚Äî so I built a **full JavaScript version** for all my fellow JS fans. 

It automatically fetches public Spotify playlist tracks, finds the best YouTube match, and downloads them as MP3s with metadata and cover art using `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`.

## üöÄ Features

- Connects to Spotify Web API for playlist data
- Searches YouTube using accurate track + artist names
- Downloads high-quality `.mp3` audio with:
  - Album art (via `--embed-thumbnail`)
  - Metadata (track name, artist)

## Spotify API setup

To use this tool, you'll need to authenticate with Spotify via the Client Credentials Flow. This requires:

This step was not possible to skip (which was the original plan), so follow [this guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started) to get two metrics,

- Client ID
- Client Secret

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repo**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DarrylMathias/Spotify-mp3-downloader.git
    cd spotify-mp3-downloader

    ```

2.  Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Create .env file

        Sample .env file :

        ```bash
        CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
        CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
        PLAYLIST_LINK=your_spotify_playlist_link
        DOWNLOAD_PATH=C:\Users\yourname\Music\Downloads
        ```

    **How to get the PLAYLIST_LINK**:

    In Spotify, right-click the playlist ‚Üí ‚ÄúShare‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCopy Link to Playlist‚Äù.

## How It Works

1. Retrieves Spotify playlist data (track names, artists, and IDs)
2. For **each track** in the playlist:
   - Searches YouTube using a combination of the track name and artist(s)
   - Downloads the best-matching video using `yt-dlp` in `.mp3` format
   - Embeds metadata and thumbnail using `ffmpeg` via `yt-dlp` flags

## Further enhancements

You can also further enhance this project by creating a CRON job that on a daily basis, checks for any changes in the API and downloads the songs accordingly. ‚ú®
